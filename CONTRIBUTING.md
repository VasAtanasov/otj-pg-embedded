We welcome contributions to this project.

1. Development of this project primarily is done on Macs (x64 and M1). However, this project should work fine in any standard Java environment with docker installed.
2. New features or changes should be accompanied by tests.
3. We are fans of clear and concise commentary and liberal usage of javadocs.
4. We recommend, but do not require signing your commits.
5. Minimal dependencies should be introduced into this project.

Currently we've not granted anyone outside of OpenTable commit rights or rights to release to Nexus OSS. We would certainly reconsider the matter in the future,
should significant community input occur.

This is one of about 35 libraries we maintain internally for Java alone, so patience is appreciated when creating a PR.
